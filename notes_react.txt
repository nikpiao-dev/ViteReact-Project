What is React? 

=> is a JavaScript Library (Not Framework) that is used to easily build and  arrange user interfaces for web applications

=> focuses on building a web applications using these things called Components


'Components' = is a self-contained section of a code that functions as a reusable building block

--- For ex. A Lego block. Each block represents a section of reusable parts. We can complicated structures or diarama if we use enough of them and we put them in correct places



React uses a syntax extension of JavaScript known as JSX (JavaScript XML)


JSX allows us to write HTML like code within your JavaScript files

React also utilizes a virtual DOM. It is a lightweight version of a  real DOM of web page

- We can keep track of any changes made to the virtual DOM and only apply that specific change to the real DOM without needing to refresh the entire web page only


JS Requirements:
- arrays
- classes 
- objects
- arrow function (ES6 Feature)

HTML Knowledge is also mandatory

Vite -> a development server. Modern replacement to create react app which is now outdated. 

- npm create vite@latest
- Enter Project name (my-react-app)
- select the framework using arrow keys (Vanilla, Vue, React, Preact, Lit, Svelte)
- Enter and select either Typescript or JavaScript

Last few commands:
cd project name
npm install
npm run dev (start the development server)

public folder and assets folder are very similar but,

files within the assets folder are bundled during the final output

public(assets) folder are not and they are generally available via a URL
